<p>My name is Kayla Romeiser. I am eighteen years old; I attend Bob Jones University; and I'm majoring in Creative Writing. I also play on the <a href="http://www.bjubruins.com/index.aspx?path=wsoc">Lady Bruins Soccer</a> team as a striker. So far, I've scored twice this season. Other than soccer and writing, I love photography. I'm minoring in photography, and I also have my own photography page on Instagram.</p>
<p>I've played soccer since I was in third or fourth grade. First, I played for a local club, <a href="http://carolinafc.net/">CFC</a>. Then, when I hit junior high, I began playing for my <a href="http://www.westgatechristianschool.com/">school</a>. Now I play for the Bruins.
<p>Most people are surprised when they find out my major is Creative Writing. They don't expect an athlete to be into that kind of thing. Since around junior high I've come to love writing stories. I've written a couple of short stories, and I'm currently working on editing a book that a friend and I co-wrote.</p>
<p>As for photography, I started to play around with my iPhone camera in 2014. Then, in 2015, I purchased my own DSLR camera. Since then I've done a couple photoshoots with friends, and also started my own <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gingasian_photography/?hl=en">photography page</a> on Instagram. So check it out and tell me what you think!
